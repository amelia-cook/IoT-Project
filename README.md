# Smart Sticky Note Board
*by Amelia Cook (arc138) and Sophie Pelton (smp147)*

#### Description
For our final project we are going to create a working smart sticky note board.
The board will connect to the Google API to display the user's calendar. On the
sticky note board, the user will be able to display various lists on different
“sticky notes” and the user will be able to set up reminders for events on
their board. We are going to create an interactive website where the user will
log into their Google account, create sticky notes, add bullet points to sticky
notes, set alarms for events or tasks, and turn the display screen on and off.
Once we have all of these components working we want to try and implement the
ability for the user to choose the template for the notes on the board through
the website.

#### Compile and Run
Connect the Pi to the hardware, then connect it to a power source. The project
code will run automatically once the Pi is connected to the internet. After
that, users can access the website to update the display. The website's current
URL is http://ameliacook.org/.

To run this project manually, the command is `python3 stickynote.py`. If the
website is not actively running, curl commands can be used to ping the API.
